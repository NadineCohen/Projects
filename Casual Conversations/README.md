Casual Conversations contains a file with the metadata from the dataset(https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/casual-conversations-dataset/) collected by Meta to obtain voice samples tagged with age, gender and skin tones.

The analysis shows the statistics of gender, age buckets(defined internally) and 2 different skin tone scales(Monk and Fitzpatrick)
