# Vox 2 Celeb
Company requested to analyse metadata from the Vox2 Celeb dataset (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html) containing voice samples from celebrities.

The analysis shows statistics of gender, age buckets(defined internally) and ethnicities.
Ages were calculated by web scraping the celebrity's date of birth from Wikipedia as well as the publish date of the video clip and performing a calculation between the two.
