Company requested to analyse metadata from the Vox2 Celeb dataset (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html) containing voice samples from celebraties.

The analysis shows statitics of gender, age buckets(defined internally) and ethnicities.
Ages were calculated by web scrapping the celebraty's date of birth from Wikipedia as well as the publish date of the video clip and performing a calculation between the two.
